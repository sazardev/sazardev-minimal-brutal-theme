# Enhanced Language Support in Carbon Code Theme

This document outlines the extended language support added to the Carbon Code Theme collection to ensure consistent syntax highlighting across multiple programming languages.

## üåü New Languages with Enhanced Support

The Carbon Code Theme now includes optimized syntax highlighting for the following languages:

### Dart & Flutter

- **Class and Types**: Properly colored class definitions and types
- **Built-in Types**: Distinct colors for primitive and built-in types
- **Functions**: Highlighted methods and functions
- **Properties**: Enhanced property and field access coloring
- **Widgets**: Special highlighting for Flutter widget components
- **String Interpolation**: Clear distinction for template expressions

### Rust

- **Types and Traits**: Proper coloring for Rust-specific types
- **Macros**: Distinct highlighting for Rust's macro system

### Swift

- **Type Definitions**: Appropriate highlighting for Swift types
- **Protocol Conformance**: Clear distinction for protocol implementations

### C#

- **Types**: Enhanced class and type colorization
- **Attributes**: Special highlighting for C# attributes

### PHP

- **Special Variables**: Distinct colors for PHP-specific variables

### Ruby

- **Symbols**: Special highlighting for Ruby symbols

### JavaScript/TypeScript

### YAML

- **Keys**: Improved key highlighting

### Java & Kotlin

- **Type System**: Enhanced coloring for Java/Kotlin type system

## üé® Color Philosophy

The enhanced language support follows the same design principles as the Carbon Code Theme:

- **Consistency**: Similar language features use similar colors across languages
- **Readability**: High contrast for important elements
- **Semantics**: Colors reflect the meaning and role of the code elements
- **Minimalism**: Clean but effective distinction between different code parts

## üß™ Testing

The theme has been tested with numerous code samples across all supported languages to ensure consistent highlighting. For specific examples, see the language demo files in the repository.

## üîç Future Improvements

We continuously work on improving language support. If you notice any inconsistencies or have suggestions for additional languages, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
